# :arrow_forward: Dynamic Programming Algorithms :arrow_backward:

This repo contains implementation solutions to various problems using DP. Most are in C++.

## Problem Contents:

- Subset Sum
- Distinct BSTs (Catalan sequence)
- Longest Palindromic Substring
- Magic Potions (3d exact weight knapsack)

### Testing

Navigate to the problem you want to test. For C++, compile with `g++ [source].cpp -o [source]`
and run the program with `./[source]`.

**Example:**
To run *longest palindrome*, navigate to `dp-algorithms/longest-palindrome`.

```bash
g++ palindrome.cpp -o palindrome
./palindrome
```

### Solutions
These solutions are likely not optimal. Improvements may be made without DP, but the
purpose of this repo is to solve problems using DP, even if that may not produce optimal runtime.
